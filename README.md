A journey of "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Instructor Angela Yu

💖💖Future Plan ~ 💖💖
On this occasion I will try to make a website development journey that I took from the Udemy course.
🎈🎈
I will publish every result that I think is good to share, and in the future there will definitely always be changes throughout the material that I learn in the course.

💌 Note : my hope, I will make a site that contains parts that are used as links and then listed on 1 page.

Let's Do It !!
